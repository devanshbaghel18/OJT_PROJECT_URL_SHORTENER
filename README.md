#URL Shortener – Django Utility Project
This project is a fully functional URL Shortener built using the Django framework. It allows users to convert long URLs into short, easy-to-share links while offering essential features like link expiry, redirect validation, and an optional QR code generator.

The goal of this project is to provide a lightweight yet powerful utility tool that demonstrates core Django concepts such as models, URL routing, views, validators, and database interactions. 
It also includes an admin interface for managing short links, monitoring usage, and controlling expiration settings.
